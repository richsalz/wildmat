# wildmat

I wrote this in 1986.  It was posted many times to Usenet and appears
in many packages. This is the original one from INN 1.4

If you need a version that handles UTF-8 Unicode, you can find it in
[the INN release](https://github.com/InterNetNews/inn/tree/main/doc/pod).

My code is in the public domain, it's old enough to have outgrown any
copyright.
